## Lesson Title
ACM - 1v1 WVR Manoeuvring (IP)

## Required Lessons
TAC-01

## Lesson Type
IP Mandatory

## Topics
Building a solid understanding of basic ACM

## Objectives
* Objective 1: Can find the enemy after a merge in the following scenarios:
* Objective 1.1: Level two circle
* Objective 1.2: Level one circle
* Objective 1.3: Two circle enemy goes high
* Objective 1.4: Two circle enemy goes low
* Objective 1.5: One circle enemy goes high
* Objective 1.6: One circle enemy goes low

* Objective 2: Can recognise the correct energy state to counter the enemy's manoeuvring
* Objective 3: Trainee can safely fly as #1 during the departure, en-route and recovery phases of flight.

## Trainee Preparation
- Read 132-TTP-Air-to-Air-1 v1.0: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mxjw8q1idcxsi8q/132-TTP-AA-1.pdf?dl=0
Focus on chapter 9, Within Visual Range


## Instructor Preparation
- Book necessary airspace to conduct the lesson.
- Prepare and provide a theoretical briefing for the lesson.
- Prepare Mission briefing.
- Prepare Mission Data Card.


## Lesson Content
This lesson will start by the IP holding a theory brief/mission brief for the flight, in which simple ACM tactics are discussed and the student is offered the opportunity to ask any necessary questions. Following this, the flight should walk and start their jets according to the established procedures. An appropriate departure will be performed with the trainee acting as the #1 in the flight until established in the MOA, where the FL will resume the #1 position.

The Instructor should take the student through a number of basic BFM sets of increasing difficulty, starting with an enforced one- or two-circle fight before demonstrating the other, then gradually increasing the difficulty of the sets and introducing altitude or energy differences at the beginning of the set. If required, Air-to-Air refuelling may be conducted.

Once all objectives have been met, the trainee will resume the #1 position and lead the flight back to recover. The student will then be debriefed by the instructor.


## Debrief
The Instructor Pilot should evaluate the students ability to understand, perform and train the following:
- The trainee is able to find the enemy after a merge.
- The trainee is able to easily identify one- and two-circle fights.
- The trainee is able to explain key concepts relating to WVR engagements.
- The trainee is able to identify the energy state of an opponent compared to their own and make decisions accordingly.
- The trainee is able to perform basic tasks in the #1 position.
