##Lesson Content
This lesson is a special form of self-qualification.
The lesson must be flown with another MQ pilot (MQ or above). MQ pilot will be Flight lead for trainee.
Once all objctives are met, you must self-qualify this lesson.

This flight should be divided in two parts:
Part 1: Low threat.
Focus is to conduct basic A-G tactics in a permissive environment: Recive 3-point attack brief, orbit in a wheel, simple talk-on. This first part is to prepare the trainee to conduct CAS and AR missions with a more dynamic flow.

Example mission: Fly to Range 3B or Range 10. Find a target, simulate a AAA or manpad threat, to enforce a weapon delivery above 10000ft, using HADB (High Altitude Dive Bombing). The flight can then conduct shooter-cover attacks.
Once part 1 is complete, head to the tanker.


Part 2: High threat.
The second part focuses on pre-planned attacks in a high threat environment to prepare for Strike, OCA attack and AI missions. The flight need to ingress low level to a IP, continue into the target to conduct coordinated attacks shooter-shooter.

Example mission: Fly to Range 3B or Range 10, find a suitable target, find a IP 10-15nm away.
