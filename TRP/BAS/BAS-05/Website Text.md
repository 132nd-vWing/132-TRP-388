## Lesson content:
This lesson must be conducted offline - do not connect to the 132nd training server unless this flight is flown with a 388th Instructor Pilot.

To complete the required objectives, the student should either launch an air-start mission or takeoff from an airfield following the appropriate checklists and SOPs. In accordance with the procedures outlined in the 388th Training Manual, the student should fly a pre-planned route (any) of at least 50nm, maintaining a chosen altitude and speed throughout.

The student pilot should then, adhering to the appropriate SOPs, rejoin an airborne tanker (at any altitude) and fly in formation with it through at least two turns, the first of which should be in the left observation position and the second of which should be flown in the right formation position.

After concluding the second turn, the student should safely break away from the tanker before performing at least two energy sustaining turns - one in each direction - at which point the lesson may be concluded. 

This lesson is conducted as a self-qualification. Once all objectives are met, you must self-qualify the lesson.
Questions regarding the content of this lesson may be directed to any 388th Instructor Pilot.
