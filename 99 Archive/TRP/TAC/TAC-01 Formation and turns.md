* Ensure that the 388th Kneeboard Pack is correctly placed into the kneeboard folder.
* Familiarise yourself with the over-head break as described in the 388th Sqn. Training Manual.

## Instructor Preparation:
- Prepare theory brief with most important topics
- Prepare Mission briefing
- Prepare Mission Data Card
- Ensure weather on the server is suitable for a formation take-off




## Lesson content:
This lesson will start by the IP holding a theory brief/mission brief for the flight.
Once in pit, pilots (IP/FL and Trainee/WM) will start-up according to 388th SOP and check-list.
The flight will taxi staggered in this training. Once ready, pilots will conduct a formation departure.
The flight will then set course to a MOA or any other available big block of airspace and will run through the various formations and turns, making sure that the trainee knows the correct wingman position in all formations.
If required, the flight will head to a tanker to do AAR.
On completion, the flight will return to the airbase and conduct a overhead break landing.

## Debrief:
The Instructor Pilot should evaluate the students ability to understand, perform and train the following:
- All formations
- All turns
