## Lesson content:
This lesson should be conducted online, on the 132nd Training Server, in two phases. During the first phase, the IP will act as FL and will conduct a formation departure before proceeding along a planned route with the student demonstrating various formations as WM. The planned route should reach a tanker and AAR should be conducted.

Once refuelling is complete, the student pilot should be given the lead and should safely conduct a return to the TMA and a recovery at home plate. A recovery appropriate for the weather conditions should be flown.

Following the flight, a debriefing should take place during which the Instructor Pilot will identify what went well during the lesson as well as areas for improvement. A grading will be provided and the Instructor Pilot will, if appropriate, award IQ status to the student and update the qualifications page accordingly.
Questions regarding the content of this lesson may be directed to any 388th Instructor Pilot.

## Debrief:
Not required.
