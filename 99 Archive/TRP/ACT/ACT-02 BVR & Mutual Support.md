## Instructor Preparation
- Coordinate with another IP/MQ pilot to support the lesson as aggressor(s). Two enemy fighters are preferable such that the student can visualise enemy fighter tactics. 
- Book necessary airspace to conduct the lesson.
- Prepare and provide a theory briefing for the lesson.
- Brief the aggressor(s) in advance of the flight.
- Prepare Mission briefing.
- Prepare Mission Data Card

## Lesson Content
This lesson will start by the IP holding a theory brief/mission brief for the flight, in which simple BVR tactics are discussed and the student is offered the opportunity to ask any necessary questions. Following this, the flight should walk and start their jets according to the established procedures. An appropriate departure will be performed with the trainee acting as the #1 in the flight until established in the MOA, where the FL will resume the #1 position. During the en-route segment, the FL should ensure that the aggressor(s) are airborne and en-route to the MOA. If required, the flight should tank whilst the aggressor(s) travel(s) to the MOA, with the FL acting as #1 for refuelling.

When established on the MOA, the FL Should retain the #1 position and arrange the conduct of a number of BVR engagements. The engagements should progress through the timeline, initially stopping before any shots are fired and progressing in complexity until the full BVR timeline is flown and game-plans are implemented. The FL should liaise with the aggressor(s) in order to maximise training opportunities.

Once all objectives have been met, the trainee will resume the #1 position and lead the flight back to recover. The student will then be debriefed by the instructor.

## Debrief
The Instructor Pilot should evaluate the students ability to understand, perform and train the following:
- Trainee able to communicate efficiently.
- Trainee able to safely follow a BVR timeline 
- Trainee able to maintain SA.
- Trainee able to function as engaged fighter and supporting fighter.
