## Objectives
- Objective 1: DCA Intercept
- Objective 2: Scramble procedures
- Objective 3: Mission planning and flight briefing for ground alert missions
- Objective 4: Flightlead and wingman practice
- Objective 5: ROE procedures
- Objective 6: AWACS coordination

## Trainee Preparation
- Read AWACS TTP: https://www.dropbox.com/s/udeqz9vxqawkiui/132-TTP-10-AWACS%20v2.0.pdf?dl=0
Focus on Scramble procedures


- Coordinate with IP/MQ pilots to support the lesson as aggressor. Aggressor can be from 388th, 108th or 494th. 
- Coordinate with 176th Controllers to support the lesson as AWACS controller
- Book necessary airspace to conduct the lesson.
- Prepare Mission briefing.
- Prepare Mission Data Card
- Prepare simple scenario

## Instructor Preparation

## Lesson Content
This lesson is conducted as a self-qualification.
Once all objectives are met, you must self-qualify this lesson.

This mission is conducted as a 2-ship flight with Student Pilot either as FL or WM.


MQ pilots will plan, prepare and brief a a ground alert DCA Mission.
MQ pilot will coordinate with a an aggressor flight (MQ or IP) and a AWACS controller.

FL will prepare and deliver a flight-brief according to 388th SOP.

Setup:
Aggressor will fly a A-A Sweep, or A-G strike mission toward a dedicated area.
Aggressor can fly ACT-04 OCA Sweep or SAT-7 and thus combining the training value for everyone involved. 
Scenario will need to be briefed to everyone involved

Scenario:
DCA Intercept flight is on 15 minute ground alert. 
AWACS is monitoring airspace, and a certain airspace is not to be intruded by hostile fighters (point, area or unit). 
Can be range, target area or anything specific needed.
At certain point the aggressor flight will be intruding or on their way to intrude to the airspace.
AWACS will then launch DCA intercept flight to intercept the incoming flight. 

Depending on AWACS and aggressor flight, this can be done to facilitate for ROE training with aggressors having various options,
either friendly, enemy, or unknown/non-actors/third party that should just be escorted out of the area.




## Debrief
- Certain aspects of this lesson will be evaluated during upgrades.
- Debrief for all participants conducted after the event using tacview going through each engagement
