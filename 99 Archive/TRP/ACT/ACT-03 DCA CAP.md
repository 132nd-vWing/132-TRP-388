## Lesson Content
This lesson is conducted as a self-qualification.
Once all objectives are met, you must self-qualify this lesson.

This mission is conducted as a 2-ship flight (minimum) or a 4-ship flight.


MQ pilots will plan, prepare and brief a DCA CAP mission.
MQ pilot will coordinate with a 2ship aggressor flight (MQ or IP). (this can be coordinated with pilots flying ACT-04 OCA SWEEP or SAT-7, 
for increased training value for everyone involved).

FL will prepare and deliver a flight-brief according to 388th SOP.

Setup:
DCA CAP flight will setup a CAP in a designated FAOR (Fighter Area of Responsibility)
The FAOR should have clear limits, and ROEs.
FAOR can be setup in any range or MOA or otherwise available airspace.



## Debrief

- Debrief for all participants conducted after the event using tacview going through each engagement
