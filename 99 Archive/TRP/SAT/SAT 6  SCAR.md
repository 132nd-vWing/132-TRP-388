## Lesson Content
This lesson is conducted as a self-qualification.
Once all objectives are met, you must self-qualify this lesson.

This mission is conducted with a minimum of 3 flights. (Flights can be single-ships). 

MQ pilots will plan, prepare and brief a SCAR mission, using the SCAR TTP.  1 flight will be the training flight doing SCAR. The other two flights are
regular AR flights. SCAR flight will depart first, establish SA and provide SCAR briefing to AR flights as they check-in.
During the mission, one flight will head for the tanker or go off station for a period, the SCAR flight will use the battle handover brief to provide SA when they return. 
After mission is complete and during RTB, flights will give a inflight-report to AWACS or to each other if no AWACS controller is available.

If available, coordinate with another pilot/controller to set-up the range, in order to increase the training value.

For the Caucasus Training Mission.  
Range 1 and Range 2A are good for the execution of this mission. (Use F10 to dynamically set-up the range. In order to activate the range, Find Range 1 or Range 2 storage, move the vehicle close to the wind-marker and the Range options are available in the F10 menu).
