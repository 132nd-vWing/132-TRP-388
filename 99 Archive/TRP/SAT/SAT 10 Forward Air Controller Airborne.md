This lesson is created to give pilots a basic understanding of the FAC(A) role in CAS procedures

## Objectives
- Know how to stack aircraft's  
- Know how to authenticate  
- Know the AO update format  
- Know the traffic and airspace update  
- Know different talk-on techniques (Talk-on, reference) - medium level talk-on and low-level talk-on  
- Know how to use marking (smoke, IR, Laser)

- Know how to perform Keyhole CAS  
- Perform both non-permissive, and permissive CAS techniques  
- Know danger close  
- Perform a mission with a time-hack (TOT-TTT: Time On Target or Time To Target)  

## Trainee Preparation
- Study reference J-FIRE pages 43-56 (A lot of illustrations, but Instructor will cover most important topics in relations to the objectives)
- Study 132-TTP-1 CAS Manual : https://www.dropbox.com/s/ee8pwhyta66zwwr/132-TTP-1%20CAS%20Manual%20v1.1.pdf?dl=0

## Instructor Preparation
- Prepare theory brief
- Plan practical event with necessary range and CAS flight support


## Lesson Content
This lesson is conducted in two parts:
1. Theory lesson covering FAC(A) specifics
2. Practical event applying what you have learned.

- Prior to the mission the FAC(A)/JTAC IP will be available for any questions. The FAC(A) candidate should have studied the events and reference material
- The FAC(A) IP will play the role as ground force commander(GFC). FAC(A) IP will also be on of the CAS flights.
- FAC(A) candidate will set-up overhead on of the ranges and prepare a AO update for the CAS flights with the information given from the GFC.
- FAC(A) candidate will conduct authentication, provide traffic and airspace update, receive fighter check-in brief and provide AO update to the CAS flights
- FAC(A) will then conduct various attacks:
  - Type 1 control
  - Keyhole IP
  - Preplanned IP
  - Type 2 control
  - Marking by laser
  - Marking by WP
  - TTT attack
  - TOT attack
  - Low level talk-on
  - Medium level talk-on
  - Type 3 control
  - Danger close

Example of layout of attacks:  
Attack 1: Non-permissive, preplanned IP, TOT, synchronized with the 2 flights, type 2 control, medium level talk-on - Against a SAM target  
Attack 2: Permissive , Keyhole IP, TTT, medium level talk-on, mark laser  
Attack 3: Permissive/non permissive, Keyhole IP, Type 1 control, Danger close, low-level/medium level  
Attack 4: Low level talk-on, Type 1, mark smoke  
Attack 5: Type 3 control
