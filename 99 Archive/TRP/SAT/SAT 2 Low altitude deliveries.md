##Lesson Content
This lesson is a special form of self-qualification.
The lesson must be flown with another MQ pilot (MQ or above). MQ pilot will be Flight lead for trainee.
Once all objectives are met, you must self-qualify this lesson.

Focus here is a non-permissive environment, with a simulated SAM threat that prevents the flight to fly medium or high altitude.
Focus on pre-planned attacks in a high threat environment to prepare for Strike, OCA attack and AI missions. The flight need to ingress low level to a IP, continue into the target to conduct coordinated attacks shooter-shooter.

Example mission: Fly to Range 3B or Range 10, find a suitable target, find a IP 10-15nm away.
