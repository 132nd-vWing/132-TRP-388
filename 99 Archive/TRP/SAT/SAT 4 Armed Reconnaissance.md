## Lesson Content
This lesson is conducted as a self-qualification.
Once all objectives are met, you must self-qualify this lesson.

This mission is conducted as a 2-ship flight (minimum) or a 4-ship flight.

MQ pilots will plan, prepare and brief a AR mission, using one of the search methods described in the TTP.
During the mission, one pilot or one element will head for the tanker, and the flight will use the battle handover brief to provide SA when they switch roles. After mission is complete and during RTB, pilots will give a inflight-report to AWACS or to each other if no AWACS controller is available.

Find a suitable range that supports a AR tasking and dynamic placement of targets.

If available, coordinate with another pilot/controller to set-up the range, in order to increase the training value.

For the Caucasus Training Mission.  
Range 1 and Range 2A are good for the execution of this mission. (Use F10 to dynamically set-up the range. In order to activate the range, Find Range 1 or Range 2 storage, move the vehicle close to the wind-marker and the Range options are available in the F10 menu).
